Used fontforge to modify MathJax_AMS-Regular to GroupExplorer_AMS-Regular by:
  copy ℤ reference from #005a to #2124 (MathJax would convert ℤ(#2124) to Z(#5A) and then use AMS font)
  copy × from MathJax_Main-Regular to GroupExplorer (MathJax would choose this glyph instead of the one from AMS)
  copy ⋅ from MathJax_Main-Regular to GroupExplorer (MathJax would choose this glyph instead of the one from AMS)
